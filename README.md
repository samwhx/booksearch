# Now Live!!!

The Live server is on https://samwhx.tk/. It supports PWA. So you can add it to home screen on your mobile phone.
> Update : The Server has been shut down for now.

# Client

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Fully working with each of the below endpoints at the server side!

---

# Server

Navigate to `/server` folder.

Run the `library_books.sql` sql script located inside `/sql_file` to generate your database.

Duplicate the `.env.sample` file and rename it `.env`. Change the details to match your system's DB information and folder locations.

Run `nodemon` for a dev server (assuming you have nodemon installed).

The server will be located at `http://localhost:3000/`, but only the below endpoints will be exposed:

# Production

Below contain the instructions to set up your own HTTPS server in production!

## AWS
1. Get a EC2 server in AWS. Use SSH to access the server. AWS will generate a key file (.pem) for you.
2. Open terminal and type the following to access AWS server.
```Bash
ssh -v -i <your-generated.pem> ubuntu@<0.0.0.0>
```
E.g. `ssh -v -i samuelwhx.pem ubuntu@13.229.207.200`. My pem file is located in the same folder i am using terminal.
3. In AWS terminal, key the following:
```Bash
mkdir app && cd app
```
4. Check if git installed
```Bash
which git
```
5.  If git not installed 
```Bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```
6. Clone your git repository
e.g. `git clone https://github.com/samwhx/booksearch.git`
7. Check if node is installed
```Bash
which node
```
8. If node not installed
```Bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```
9. Install the node modules for both client and server.
```Bash
npm i
cd server/
npm i
```
10. Go back to client folder and edit the `environments/environment.prod.ts` to reflect your new urls.

## PM2 to run server even after closing the terminal
```Bash
npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start index.js
pm2 startup
```
Copy and paste the command given to you. E.g. `sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u ubuntu --hp /home/ubuntu`
```Bash
pm2 save
sudo reboot
```

## Domain Name
Go to https://www.freenom.com/en/index.html?lang=en to get a free web domain.

Map your AWS public IPV4 to your new domain name.

## Build angular project
Build your project in angular.
```Bash
ng build --prod --base-href=<your new domain name>/
```
E.g. `ng build --prod --base-href=https://samwhx.tk/` 
Push it to github.

## SQL server
Install SQL on AWS using the guide at https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-18-04.

Run the the following statements inside mysql to generate database. The file is provided at `/server/sql_file/library_books.sql`
```Bash
mysql>CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
mysql>USE <database_name>;
mysql>source /path/to/your/file.sql;
```
Update the `server/.env` file with your mysql details. a sample is provided at `server/.env.sample`.

Also update the folder path of your `public/images` folder. Navigate to the folder using `cd <folder name>` and use the following to find out the path of the folder in your system.
```Bash
pwd
```
E.g. `/home/samuel/Workspace/fsf/server/library/server/public/images`

## Nginx to manage HTTPS (SSL)
```Bash
sudo -s
nginx=stable
add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/$nginx
apt-get update
apt-get install nginx
```

## Register SSL free using CertBot
```Bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx 
sudo certbot --nginx
sudo -s
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
nano default
```
Using the nano editor:
1. Delete the original configuration for port 80 under server {}.
2. In location for the new server{} with all the pre-generated elements by certbot change location to the following:
```Bash
location /  {
                proxy_pass    http://localhost:3000;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
```
Save and exit the nano editor.
Run the following command lines after that:
```Bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
exit
```

Done!!! Check if your website is working by entering Your domain address. E.g. https://samwhx.tk
